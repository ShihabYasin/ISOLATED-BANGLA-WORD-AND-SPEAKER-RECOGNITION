## Abstract:     

Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of his/her voices and speech recognition concerns the recognizing of what is being said by the speaker. This paper presents a framework to recognize the isolated Bangla words and the corresponding speaker by proposing a semantic modular time delay neural network (MTDNN). Underlying acoustic fuzziness of human utterance and fluctuations of data due to environmental disturbance are managed by well-known Fuzzy C Means clustering technique. We have used MFCC features to recognize Bangla words and speaker detection. Experimental result with different individuals show that the proposed framework is functioning quite satisfactory with average accuracy of 82.66%.

## Introduction

Scientifically speech recognition is the process of converting an acoustic waveform to a suitable written equivalent of the message or information. Speaker recognition on the other hand is the task of recognizing and separating internal frequency spectrum using some processing such that intelligent agent can differ every subject accurately. One of the fundamental capabilities of human is to use natural language to express their emotions to transmit and receive information. Effective use of language is intertwined with our general cognitive abilities. Evolution makes brain an efficient dynamic structure that can learn quickly and can generalize its knowledge dramatically. An interesting field of computer science is to use this intuitive capability of human as input to computing process and transform it into different required outputs. It is difficult for computing system for recognizing speech and speaker as for higher dimensional data values, robustness and variability embedded within data, failure of non-machine learning based approach and need for huge processing speed with great memory capability.
